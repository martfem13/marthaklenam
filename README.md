# Aspiring data scientist
Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Martha Klenam Tsagli. I am an aspiring data scientist
I wish to change the status quo by becoming the very first female data scientist in my family. I hope to build myself amongst a resillient community.
I wish to learn more, practice daily and upgrade my skills in the data science field. 
I love taking risk, I love learning new things and this zeal has made learning data science a real good passion for me. 
I want to be able to build machine learning models that will aid in making predictions close to reality and that happening is a whole lifetime fulfilment . 
Having to provide strategic decisions and insightful solutions is something I want to do over and over again.
Welcome to my space and I hope you learn something new!ðŸ˜‰
